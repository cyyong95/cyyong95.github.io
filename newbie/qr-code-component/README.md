### Built with
- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned
- Flexbox  
  - Managed to learn the `flex-direction` property
  - Found out that centering a div is super easy using flexbox
- CSS Variables
  - Declaring values as variables promote reusability
  - Reduce chances of typing in the wrong value for properties
- Media Query
  - `min-width` on media query means that the screen size must reach certain minimum width before the css declared in media query will work
  - `max-width` on media query means that if the screen size doesn't go above the max width, the css declared in the media query will work
